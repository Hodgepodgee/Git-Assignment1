1.What is Verson Control System ?
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track
 of modifications done in the code.
A version control system is a kind of software that helps the developer team to efficiently communicate and manage(track)
 all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like who made and what changes have 
been made. A separate branch is created for every contributor who made the changes and the changes arenâ€™t merged into 
the original source code unless all are analyzed as soon as the changes are green signaled they merged to the main 
source code. It not only keeps source code organized but also improves productivity by making the development 
process smooth.
2. What is Git ?
Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle 
small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers
 to work together on non-linear development.
3.What is Repository ?
In Git, the repository is like a data structure used by VCS to store metadata for a set of files and directories. 
It contains the collection of the files as well as the history of changes made to those files. Repository in Git is 
considered as your project folder. A repository has all the project-related data. Distinct projects have distinct 
repositories.
4.What is Git Bash ?
Git Bash is an application that provides Git command line experience on the Operating System. It is a command-line shell
 for enabling git with the command line in the system. A shell is a terminal application used to interface with an 
operating system through written commands
5.What is Github ?
Github is a code hosting platform for VSC and lets you and others work together on project from anywhere in the world.
this is where developers can store their projects and networks with like minded people. 
6.What is Branch in Git ?
A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. It is a feature available in most 
modern version control systems. A Git project can have more than one branch. These branches are a pointer to a snapshot 
of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug, you spawn a new branch to summarize your changes.
 So, it is complex to merge the unstable code with the main code base and also facilitates you to clean up your future
 history before merging with the main branch
7.What is Commit in Git ?
It is used to record the changes in the repository. It is the next command after the git add.
 Every commit contains the index data and the commit message. Every commit forms a parent-child relationship. 
When we add a file in Git, it will take place in the staging area. A commit command is used to fetch updates 
from the staging area to the repository.
